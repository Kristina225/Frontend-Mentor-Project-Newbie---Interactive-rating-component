## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This is the first project that I did that has Javascript in it. I practiced using DOM events. I learned about bubbling and how I can add an event listener only on the parent element and access the child elements through the `.target` property.
